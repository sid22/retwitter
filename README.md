## Tests

I have used primarily python's unittest module and Django's Test Client to test the handler funtions and endpoints respectively. 

The coverage reports for the same have also been generated and are present in the /docs folder in the main repo.

The reports are hosted on Github pages and can be seen [Coverage Report](https://sid22.github.io/retwitter/)


The project has also been integrated with Travis CI system to automate testing and keep a build status.

Currently the coverage of tests is 89%.

Travis Builds can be seen [Travis Builds](https://travis-ci.org/sid22/retwitter)
